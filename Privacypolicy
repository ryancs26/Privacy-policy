          <h3>Do you have to provide your Personal Information to Inservio?</h3>
          <p>You may interact with us anonymously or via a pseudonym where it is lawful and practicable to do so. However, some of our products or services require you to provide us with your Personal Information. There are also aspects of our business that by law require us to collect Personal Information about you, so we can fulfill your request. In these situations, if you choose to withhold your Personal Information, it may not be possible for Inservio to fulfil your request.</p>

          <h3>Disclosure of your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>Inservio shares your Personal Information with our Partners and Related Entities, Third Parties, Service Providers and Contractors of Inservio (collectively called Parties). We outsource some of our service offerings to our Parties. Our Parties are restricted from using your Personal Information in any way other than to provide services on our behalf, or services for a collaboration in which they and Inservio are engaged. We limit the Personal Information we share with Parties to only that which is reasonably necessary for them to fulfil their obligations to us. Where Inservio engages a Party, we ensure that they will protect your Personal Information to at least the same standard as set out in this Policy.</p>
          <p>Inservio may provide your Personal Information to a Party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of Inservio to which the information relates, in which case Inservio will require any such buyer to agree to manage your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
          <p>We will otherwise only disclose Personal Information about you to a third party where required or authorised by or under Law, including to regulatory authorities, or where we have notified you.</p>

          <h3>Sharing Personal Information outside Australia</h3>
          <p>Inservio does not routinely share your Personal Information outside Australia. However, if we are required by law to do so, we will ensure that the disclosure is only to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfil the requested purpose, and as required or authorised by Law.</p>

          <h3>Securing your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>Inservio takes reasonable steps to keep secure your Personal Information to protect it from misuse, interference or loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We use reasonable organisational, technical and administrative measures and safeguards to protect the Personal Information that we hold. Our security controls are continuously reviewed and revised based on new technological developments and security advancements. Access to Personal Information by Inservio staff is provisioned in accordance with our strict access controls. Inservio stores your Personal Information securely.</p>
          <p>Personal Information is kept for the requisite number of years to comply with legal requirements. Any Personal Information that we no longer need is securely disposed of after retention periods are met.</p>

          <h3>Your right to access and correct Personal Information</h3>
          <p>You have a right to seek access to or correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. You can exercise this right by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact details provided below.
